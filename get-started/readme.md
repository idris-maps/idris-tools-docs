## Do you have geodata ?

### Yes

If it is a [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) file. You can make a map now. 

* Create an [image](../image-map)
* Or a [zoomable map](../zoomable-map)

If your geodata is stored as [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text), [GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) or [SHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), convert it to [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) with our [converter](../convert)
